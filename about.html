            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-secondary mb-6">Who Am I?</h2>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700">My journey into marketing began with a simple curiosity‚Äîhow do businesses thrive in today‚Äôs fast-paced, competitive world? Though I studied Mechanical Engineering, I was drawn to the strategies that power business success, which led me to discover the dynamic and ever-evolving world of marketing.</p>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mt-4">Eager to break into the field, I started from the ground up, working with small agencies in India where I took on unpaid roles just to get hands-on experience. This phase gave me exposure to real campaigns, tools, and client interactions‚Äîbuilding a strong foundation. My hunger to learn and grow quickly paid off.</p>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mt-4">As I moved into larger roles, my responsibilities expanded significantly. At Optymice Growth Consulting, I handled end-to-end digital campaigns and played a critical role in scaling a caf√© business from 1 to 7 franchise locations across South India in just five months‚Äîgenerating ‚Çπ60+ lakh in revenue with a digital ad spend of only ‚Çπ4 lakh. This experience sharpened my skills in paid media, social strategy, and lead generation.</p>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mt-4">Riding on that success, I took the next leap to Iopex Technologies, managing campaigns for global brands like Amazon, GG Poker, and American Express across the Irish market. As a Technical Account Strategist for Quantcast, I oversaw over 40 advertisers, delivering up to 500x ROAS and optimizing campaigns across platforms like Salesforce and Quantcast. My efforts were recognized with the ‚ÄúDublin Star‚Äù award, marking a high point in my professional journey.</p>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mt-4">Realizing the need to pair my technical marketing expertise with strategic leadership capabilities, I decided to pursue an MBA at University Canada West in Vancouver. This move wasn‚Äôt just academic‚Äîit was intentional. I wanted to evolve from executing campaigns to leading marketing teams, shaping vision, and driving long-term brand growth. The MBA program helped me develop a broader perspective in business strategy, analytics, and leadership.</p>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mt-4">While studying, I continued to gain local experience in Canada through part-time roles that honed my customer service, team collaboration, and problem-solving skills in fast-paced environments. This not only expanded my professional adaptability but also deepened my cultural understanding and interpersonal effectiveness.</p>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mt-4">Now, with a strong foundation in digital marketing, a proven history of delivering measurable results, and an MBA from University Canada West in Vancouver, I‚Äôm equipped to take on strategic leadership roles in the Canadian marketing landscape. My goal is to lead high-performing teams, drive innovative campaigns, and contribute to meaningful business growth through data-driven, customer-focused marketing strategies.</p>
